## Example Provisioner Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  # If nil, the feature is disabled, nodes will never expire
  ttlSecondsUntilExpired: 2592000 # 30 Days = 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 Seconds;

  # If nil, the feature is disabled, nodes will never scale down due to low utilization
  ttlSecondsAfterEmpty: 30

  # Provisioned nodes will have these taints
  # Taints may prevent pods from scheduling if they are not tolerated
  taints:
    - key: example.com/special-taint
      effect: NoSchedule

  # Labels are arbitrary key-values that are applied to all nodes
  labels:
    billing-team: my-team

  # Requirements that constrain the parameters of provisioned nodes.
  # These requirements are combined with pod.spec.affinity.nodeAffinity rules.
  # Operators { In, NotIn } are supported to enable including or excluding values
  requirements:
    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type" 
      operator: In
      values: ["m5.large", "m5.2xlarge"]
    - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" 
      operator: In
      values: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch" 
      operator: In
      values: ["arm64", "amd64"]
    - key: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type" # If not included, the webhook for the AWS cloud provider will default to on-demand
      operator: In
      values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
  # These fields vary per cloud provider, see your cloud provider specific documentation
  provider: {}
```

## spec.requirements

Kubernetes defines the following [Well-Known Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/), and cloud providers (e.g., AWS) implement them. They are defined at the "spec.requirements" section of the Provisioner API. 

These well known labels may be specified at the provisioner level, or in a workload definition (e.g., nodeSelector on a pod.spec). Nodes are chosen using the both the provisioner's and pod's requirements. If there is no overlap, nodes will not be launched. In other words, a pod's requirements must be within the provisioner's requirements. If a requirement is not defined for a well known label, any value available to the cloud provider may be chosen.

For example, an instance type may be specified using a nodeSelector in a pod spec. If the instance type requested is not included in the provisioner list and the provisioner has instance type requirements, Karpenter will not create a node or schedule the pod. 

üìù None of these values are required. 

### Instance Types

- key: `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`

Generally, instance types should be a list and not a single value. Leaving this field undefined is recommended, as it maximizes choices for efficiently placing pods. 

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS**

Review [AWS instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

The default value includes all instance types with the exclusion of metal
(non-virtualized),
[non-HVM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html),
and GPU instances.

View the full list of instance types with `aws ec2 describe-instance-types`.

**Example**

*Set Default with provisioner.yaml*

```yaml
spec:
  requirements:
    - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
      operator: In
      values: ["m5.large", "m5.2xlarge"]
```

*Override with workload manifest (e.g., pod)*

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: m5.large
```

### Availability Zones

- key: `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
- value example: `us-east-1c`

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS**

- value list: `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region <region-name>`

Karpenter can be configured to create nodes in a particular zone. Note that the Availability Zone `us-east-1a` for your AWS account might not have the same location as `us-east-1a` for another AWS account.

[Learn more about Availability Zone
IDs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html)

### Architecture

- key: `kubernetes.io/arch`
- values
  - `amd64` (default)
  - `arm64`

Karpenter supports `amd64` nodes, and `arm64` nodes.


### Capacity Type

- key: `karpenter.sh/capacity-type`

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS**

- values
  - `spot` (default)
  - `on-demand` 

Karpenter supports specifying capacity type, which is analogous to [EC2 purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html).


## spec.kubeletConfiguration

Karpenter provides the ability to specify a few additional Kubelet args. These are all optional and provide support for 
additional customization and use cases. Adjust these only if you know you need to do so.

```yaml
spec:
  kubeletConfiguration:
    clusterDNS: ["10.0.1.100"]
    maxPods: 100
```

### spec.kubeletConfiguration.maxPods

According to the Kubelet spec, this value must be a non-negative number. However, since some tools use other flags to 
indicate when max pods should not be used (such as the AL2 EKS-optimized AMI which uses `--use-max-pods=false`), a 
negative value can be specified. The Karpenter provider code will catch this case and handle it appropriately, ensuring 
a negative value isn't passed to the underlying kubelet configuration.


## spec.provider

This section is cloud provider specific. Reference the appropriate documentation:
